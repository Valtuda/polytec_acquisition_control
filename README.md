# polytec_acquisition_control
Acquisition control library for polytec vibrometers, based on PolyTec's Python example code.

# Requirements
This requres the Python polytec package provided by Polytec GmbH, Waldbrunn under LGPLv3 but not available anywhere online. I received my copy through private communication with the supplier. The Python package can be made to work under Linux (even though it is published by Polytec as a Windows-only feature). I might toss up the code for that at a later time.

# Functionality
In flux right now. Trying to expose most key features to data acquisition and device setting in a series of classes, to be merged into a single class which will be able to link to other control software.

# Copyright Notice

This package is based on parts of the example code provided by Polytec GmbH, Waldbrunn with every vibrometer, and uses the polytec Python library based on the Device Communication software also released by Polytec GmbH, Waldbrunn, under the LGPLv3.
