# polytec_acquisition_control
Acquisition control library for polytec vibrometers, based on PolyTec's Python example code.

# Requirements
This requres the Python polytec package provided by Polytec GmbH, Waldbrunn under LGPLv3 but not available anywhere online. I received my copy through private communication with the supplier. The Python package can be made to work under Linux (even though it is published by Polytec as a Windows-only feature). I might toss up the code for that at a later time.

# Functionality
In flux right now. Trying to expose most key features to data acquisition and device setting in a series of classes, to be merged into a single class which will be able to link to other control software.
